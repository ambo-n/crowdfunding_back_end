## Planning:
### Concept/Name
Sprout is a community-focused crowdfunding platform dedicated to supporting conservation and outdoor recreation projects. Whether developing new parks, restoring rivers and wildlife habitats, or creating outdoor spaces that inspire future generations, Sprout empowers communities and public land managers to bring their visions to life. By connecting passionate individuals with meaningful environmental projects, we help ensure a greener, more accessible outdoors for everyone.

### Intended Audience/User Stories

Sprout can be used as a platform to raise donation towards charities of interest or launch crowdfunding campaigns for local conservation and outdoor projects.

### API Spec

It might look messy here in the PDF, but once it's rendered it looks very neat! 

It can be helpful to keep the markdown preview open in VS Code so that you can see what you're typing more easily. }}
